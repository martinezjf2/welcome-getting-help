# Pair with a Technical Coach



This is challenging material and you will find yourself in positions where you don’t know how to move forward 
or what to try next. We are here to help you keep moving through the curriculum and to solidify the concepts 
that you are learning. You are not alone! 

It helps to talk problems through with individuals who have experienced many of the same problems as you!
That’s where the Pair with a TC (Technical Coach) tool come in.

### What is Pair with a Technical Coach (PTC)?

Service provided by the Academic Success Team at Flatiron
School for further support on labs or concepts through Zoom screenshares as you work your way through the 
curriculum.

The team does not provide any support on
projects or assessments, but can jump in a screen share to work with you on
environment issues (unrelated to projects or assessments) or help you make
progress on curriculum labs.

### Who are we?

Trained technical coaches, most of whom are Flatiron School Graduates and software engineering professionals who are excited to support you and share their wealth of knowledge to the Flatiron School community. 

### Who we support?

TCs only support enrolled students. Anyone working through prework, try
experiences, or alumni in post-work will not get TC support.

### When can students use this service?

- LIVE/In-Person Students
  - Monday-Friday, 6pm - Midnight EST; Saturday and Sunday 9am - Midnight EST

- FLEX Students 
  - 7 Days a Week, 9am - Midnight EST;

** Times are subject to change for Holidays

### What can students expect when using this service?

- Model problem-solving techniques such as asking questions to assist in breaking down concepts to
guide you to a solution. Our TCs are trained to teach and guide in the same way as your full-time instructors, which means you won’t always get an answer straight away.

- There will likely be a wait time. We do our best to
  staff our service in a way that meets demand, but if all of our TCs are tied up
  with other students in a given period of time, you may need to wait a little to
  speak live with someone.

- You should expect to screen share, and to pair program with a TC. Please make sure to download Zoom to 
interact with a Technical Coach. 

- You likely won’t work with a TC all the way through to completing a lab or a
  final solution. More often than not, they’ll help you get unstuck and give you
  guidance to continue learning on your own.

- Our team syncs up with the rest of the instructional staff at Flatiron School.
  Your interactions on this team won’t happen in a vacuum, and if there is a need
  to loop in your full-time instructor, we will.

### What do TCs expect of students?

- Be kind: We know you might be frustrated or under stress, and we really are
  here to help you and see you succeed.
- Be patient: We support a whole lot of students, and it’s hard to predict wait
  times. We’re working as diligently as we can to get through the queue.
- Be collaborative: We aren’t going to code for you, or give you the answers
  straight away. It’s all a part of the learning process!
- Be curious and open-minded: We want you to feel comfortable of using developer tools, and discover
  what outcomes can be. See why things may not be working and implement other techniques that can assist
  in getting students a step closer to a solution.

### How does it all work?

Zendesk Chat is built into Canvas, so as you’re working through the curriculum,
you should see a chat box floating in the bottom right corner of your screen:

You’ll be asked to fill out some quick info:

![Pair with a TC - Step 2](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/homeroom/welcome-getting-help/pair-with-a-tc-2.png)

Then you’ll get a response with us giving you some tips on what you can do while you wait, and your position in our queue. If you end up not needing a TC before getting connected to one, you can always click “End Chat” yourself to be removed from the queue.

programmer, we are here to support you! If you are stuck, do not hesitate to ask
for help!
