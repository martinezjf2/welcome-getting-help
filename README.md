## When to ask for help

It is important to know when to reach out for help. Waiting too long can build frustration that hinders your learning.  Coming in too soon prevents you from learning by trial and error and can hold you back from developing problem-solving skills.  Learning how to effectively problem-solve on your own is paramount to your success in the program and the industry.  We are here to help you once you’ve exhausted all of your options on your own. The general rule is to troubleshoot for 30 minutes before asking for help.
