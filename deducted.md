## Try Troubleshooting First

Whenever possible, you should try to troubleshoot your issue independently first
before seeking help.

Some examples of independent troubleshooting might look like:

- Reading the Readme thoroughly for the lesson you’re on to make sure you’re not
  missing relevant details
- Reviewing previous lessons that may apply to the error or issue you’re
  experiencing
- Googling your error or related concepts
- Using debugging tools like [Pry](http://pry.github.io/) to understand your
  error better (we'll introduce Pry to you soon)
- Checking out
  [Flatiron's help articles](https://flatironschoolsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
  — these articles include advice and answers to frequently asked questions from
  the Flatiron School Team.

Even if you aren't able to find an answer on your own, taking the time to try
the options above can help you clarify the question you're asking and eliminate
unsuccessful solutions to the problem. Troubleshooting on your own means that
when you _do_ reach out, you'll be able to ask better, more specific questions.

## Reach Out to Your Peers via Slack

There is a good chance that fellow students have encountered similar challenges
to yours. Use the Slack channels available to you to get help.

Equally, if you find someone asking a question that you can provide insight on,
please do! One of the best ways to confirm your own understanding of a concept
is to try and help someone else understand it.
